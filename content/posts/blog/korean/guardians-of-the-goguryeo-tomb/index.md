## 한국어

옛날 무덤에서 발견된 벽화를 통해 고구려 사람들의 생활과 문화를 알 수 있습니다. 벽화에는 삼족오가 살고 있는 해, 달, 꽃, 사람 등 다양한 그림이 그려져 있습니다.

사람들은 달에는 두꺼비가 살았고, 해에는 3개의 다리를 가진 까마귀인 삼족어가 살고 있다고 생각했습니다. 또한 사방을 지키는 사방신이 있다고 생각했는데, 동쪽에는 청룡, 서쪽에는 백호, 남쪽에는 불새와 비교할 수 있는 주작, 그리고 북쪽에는 검은색의 거북이인 현무입니다.

## English

Wall paintings found in ancient tombs show us the life and culture of the Goguryeo people. In the painting, there are many pictures such as the sun with a three legged crow, the moon, flowers, people, and so on.

People thought that a toad lived on the moon and a crow with 3 legs called Samjokoe lived on the sun. They also thought there were four guardians who protected the four directions. The blue dragon, Cheongnyong was in the east, the white tiger, Baekho was in the west, a kind of red phoenix, Jujak was in the south and the black tortoise, Hyeonmu was in the north.
