한국에서는 고유의 문자 한글이 있습니다.

한글을 창제하였습니다.

​

Hangeul was first published on October 9th, 1443 ; a day which

became known as "Hangeul Day".

한글(훈민정음)은 1443년 10월 9일에 반포되었고,

이 날을 한글날로 지정하여 기념하고 있습니다.

​

Hangeul is a phonemic writing system, which means

each symbol corresopnds to a specific sound.

한글은 각각의 글자가 하나의 소리에 대응되는 음소문자입니다.

that make up each syllable.

로마자와 달리, 자모음을 합쳐서 음절 단위로 합쳐서 사용합니다.

글을 쉽게 배울 수 있도록 만들어졌기 때문에,

논리적이며 간결하고 효율적인 문자입니다.
